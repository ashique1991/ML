This CSV file contains a dataset of 240 stars of 6 classes:

Brown Dwarf -> Star Type = 0

Red Dwarf -> Star Type = 1

White Dwarf-> Star Type = 2

Main Sequence -> Star Type = 3

Supergiant -> Star Type = 4

Hypergiant -> Star Type = 5

The Luminosity and radius of each star is calculated w.r.t. that of the values of Sun.
Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts
Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m


Temperature (K) = This column consists of the Surface temperatures of several stars
Luminosity(L/Lo) = This column consists of the Luminosity of several stars calculated with respect to sun(L/Lo)
Absolute magnitude(Mv) = This column consists of the Radius of several stars calculated with respect to sun(R/Ro)
Star type = This column is the output class (6 classes ranging from 0-5) 0 -> Brown Dwarf 1-> Red Dwarf 2 -> White Dwarf 3-> Main
Star color = This column contains the info about the colors of each star after Spectral Analysis
Spectral Class = This column contains info about the spectral classes of each star(O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
